# Amazon Customer Review Project
In this projected I analyzed data from the Amazon Web Service. 
I used Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent and more during my work on this project.
This project was written in Python, Using Google Colab.
## Project Overview:
This project could be split into 4 main parts:
* Connecting to Amazon and downloading data using boto3
* preprocessing the data and doing some feature engineering using simple NLP
* fitting different classification models and making predictions
* Using the Idea of mini batches in order to analyze data when memory is finite.
